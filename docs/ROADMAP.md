---

## Phase 1 - Foundation ✅
Migration: `000001_init.up.sql`

Built:
- Users, entries, dead letter queue schema
- Audio upload pipeline (presign → MinIO PUT → entry creation → Redis job)
- Whisper transcription worker
- Supabase JWT auth + auto-provisioning
- Basic entry CRUD with pagination
- Health check endpoint

---

## Phase 2 - AI Core ✅
Migration: `000002_phase2.up.sql`

Built:
- Full `entry_analysis` schema (mood_score, emotional_tone, topics, key_quotes, reflection, morning_nudge, is_crisis)
- Two-stage crisis detection (keyword + Claude confirmation, fail-safe)
- Context builder (last 5 entries → emotion trend + topic trend injected into prompts)
- Claude reflection generation (structured JSON output, 7-field schema)
- Follow-up conversations (3-turn cap, grounded in original entry)
- Mood tracking: GET /mood/weekly + GET /mood/streak
- Full-text search via tsvector + GIN index
- FCM push notifications + user_devices table
- Morning nudge scheduler (timezone-aware, polls every 60s)
- Timeline endpoint (entries + analyses combined)

---

## Phase 3 - Local Auth ✅
Migration: `000003_auth.up.sql`

Built:
- `password_hash` column on users
- POST /auth/register + POST /auth/login via bcrypt + JWT
- Dev-friendly: no Supabase setup required

---

## Phase 4 - Retention & Growth ✅

### 4a - Onboarding ✅
- Goal selection screen on first open (stress / anxiety / grief / relationships / career / curious)
- Goal stored in users table (new column)
- Goal injects into Claude system prompt to personalize reflection tone
- "What name should I call you?" during onboarding

### 4b - Weekly Emotional Review ✅
- Hourly scheduler: schedules pending row on last Sunday 10 AM per user's timezone (idempotent)
- Claude generates a "week in review" narrative from the 7-day entry summaries
- FCM push delivered on completion; narrative stored in `weekly_reviews` table
- GET /reviews/weekly/latest and GET /reviews/weekly API endpoints
- Weekly review card displayed on mobile Mood screen

### 4c - Streak Mechanics Overhaul ✅
- Streak freeze: `streak_freeze_count` on users (max 3); auto-granted 1 per week via WeeklyReviewScheduler; POST /streak/freeze to apply
- Freeze days stored in `streak_freeze_days` table; included in streak calculation (union with entry days)
- GET /mood/streak returns `next_milestone` and `freeze_count`
- "Comeback" card when streak == 0 (non-guilt language + freeze button if available)
- Milestone modal celebration at 7 / 21 / 50 / 100 days with share via native Share API

### 4d - Shareable Insight Cards ✅
- Not the journal content - anonymized mood arc + top emotion for the week
- Generate as image on mobile, share via native share sheet
- Zero-cost viral acquisition loop

### 4e - Hindi + Hinglish Support ✅
- Whisper already detects language and returns it in `entries.language`
- New Hindi system prompt in prompts.go
- Hinglish detection (mixed Hindi-English) → use Hinglish prompt variant
- Language auto-detected, no user setting needed

### 4f - Prompt Modes ✅
- Rant Mode: no analysis, just transcription + acknowledgement
- Gratitude Mode: AI asks 3 specific gratitude follow-ups after listening
- Decision Mode: Socratic follow-up for decisions
- Processing Mode: current default
- Dream Mode: dual-lens dream analysis (see 4f-i)
- Mode selection on record screen

### 4f-i - Dream Decoder (Dual Lens) ✅
Migrations: `000016_dream_decoder.up.sql`, `000023_dream_lenses.up.sql`

When a user records a dream entry (`mode = "dream"`), the analysis pipeline runs a specialized prompt that produces two interpretive lenses in addition to the standard reflection fields:

**Psychological lens** (`psychological_lens`): Jungian / depth-psychology reading. Draws on Jungian archetypes (shadow, anima/animus, Self), universal dream symbols (water = unconscious, house = self, falling = loss of control, being chased = avoidance), and explores what the dream might be touching emotionally. Warm and exploratory, not diagnostic.

**Vedic lens** (`vedic_lens`): Vedic Svapna Shastra / Hindu mythology reading. Draws on dream symbolism from the Atharva Veda, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, and classical texts. Considers time-of-dream (pre-dawn = sattvic/significant), auspicious symbols (cows, elephants, white flowers, clear water, temples, deities), inauspicious symbols (corpses, teeth falling, darkness, oil), and recurring dreams as potential samskaric patterns. Presented as a cultural/spiritual perspective, not a prediction.

Both lenses are stored in `entry_analysis.psychological_lens` and `entry_analysis.vedic_lens` (TEXT, NULL for non-dream entries). Both appear in `GET /entries/:id/analysis` when `mode = "dream"`.

### 4g - Life Graph ✅
- 30 / 90 / 365 day mood trendline with range selector
- Period-over-period mood delta (avg_mood vs prior equal window)
- Top-3 emotion aggregation across the selected window
- GET /mood/history?range=30d|90d|365d - daily avg, weighted overall avg, prior-period avg, top emotions
- LifeGraph component in mood.tsx replaces Pattern Radar placeholder

---

## Phase 5 - Scale & B2B ✅
Migrations: `000008_phase5a.up.sql`, `000009_phase5c.up.sql`, `000010_phase5g.up.sql`

### 5a - Therapist Sharing Mode ✅
- `share_links` table: 32-byte random token + bcrypt-hashed 4-digit passcode, 72h TTL
- `POST /share` (auth) → create link, returns plaintext passcode once
- `GET /share/:token?p=xxxx` (public) → validate passcode, return anonymised view
- Mobile: `app/share/[id].tsx` - generate link, show passcode, send via native Share sheet
- View includes: 30-day mood arc, AI entry summaries, top emotions; NO transcripts or reflections

### 5b - Crisis → Care Bridge ✅
- Crisis reflection screen completely redesigned: structured hotline cards (iCall, Vandrevala, 988)
- Tap-to-call via `Linking.openURL('tel:...')`
- "Find a therapist near you" CTA → Practo affiliate URL with UTM tracking
- YourDOST online therapy option
- `crisisResponse()` returns plain text, rendering is entirely in mobile

### 5c - B2B Corporate Wellness ✅
- `companies` + `company_members` tables (migration 000009)
- `v_team_daily_mood` view: fully anonymised, never exposes individual identities
- `POST /b2b/companies/:slug/join` - user self-enrolls
- `GET /b2b/companies/:slug/mood?range=30d|90d` - admin-only aggregated mood dashboard
- Threshold alert: `is_alerted=true` when avg_mood < 40

### 5d - PDF Export ✅
- `GET /export/pdf?period=monthly|yearly` - streams binary PDF (auth-protected)
- Uses `go-pdf/fpdf` for pure-Go A4 generation
- PDF structure: cover page → mood overview (stats cards + bar chart + emotion bars) → entry summaries
- Mobile: `app/export.tsx` - period picker, `expo-file-system.downloadAsync` with auth header, `expo-sharing.shareAsync`
- Linked from Settings → Export my data

### 5e - Apple Health / Google Fit Integration ✅
- `src/services/health.ts`: `writeMindfulSession({ startDate, endDate })`
- iOS: HealthKit via `react-native-health`, requests `MindfulSession` write permission
- Android: Google Fit stub (same interface, implementation pending Google Fit credentials)
- Called from `app/processing/[id].tsx` the moment entry status=completed
- Fails silently - health write errors never surface to the user

### 5f - Clinical Validation
- Partner with NIMHANS or AIIMS psychology department
- 90-day study: does daily voice journaling reduce self-reported anxiety?
- Outcome: peer-reviewed study, "clinically validated" positioning
- (Not a software deliverable - business development track)

### 5g - Therapist Dashboard API (B2B2C) ✅
- `therapists` + `client_therapist_links` tables (migration 000010)
- `POST /therapists/register` - therapist self-registers
- `POST /therapists/clients/link` - link a client by UUID (client shares ID from app settings)
- `GET /therapists/clients` - list clients with 30d avg mood + last entry date
- `GET /therapists/clients/:id/brief` - Claude-generated 3-sentence pre-session brief
- Brief includes: 7d avg mood, trend (improving/declining/stable), top emotions, last 5 entry summaries
- Prompt lives in `services/prompts.go::BuildTherapistBriefPrompt`
- **Therapist web portal** (`therapist-portal/`): Next.js 14 app (separate from mobile)
  - `/login` - JWT auth via existing `/auth/login`
  - `/dashboard` - client list, add by UUID, remove
  - `/dashboard/clients/:id` - full brief with mood stats, trend icon, entry cards
  - Stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Recharts

---

## Phase 6 - Therapy Mode ✅
Migration: `000018_therapy_mode.up.sql`

Real-time AI-assisted voice/text conversation sessions. Synchronous (not worker-queued). Journal-context-aware - Claude knows the user's mood history, emotional patterns, and recent entries before the first word is spoken.

Positioned as: **"AI-assisted reflection session grounded in your journal history"** - not a therapy replacement.

Built:
- `therapy_sessions` + `therapy_messages` tables + `therapy_session_status` ENUM (active | completed | expired | crisis_detected)
- `internal/repositories/therapy.go` - session CRUD, message storage, context snapshot
- `internal/services/therapy.go` - full session lifecycle (start, send message, end, expiry check, billing)
- `buildTherapyModeSystemPrompt()` + `buildTherapyPostSessionPrompt()` in `prompts.go`
- `internal/handlers/therapy.go` - all 6 endpoints registered in router
- Crisis detection runs on every message (Stage 1 + Stage 2, fail-safe) per ADR-013
- Context snapshot loaded at session start: last 5 entry summaries, top emotions, top topics, 30-day avg mood
- Session hard-cap 1 hour enforced server-side via `expires_at` per ADR-012
- Audio deleted after transcription per ADR-005
- Mobile: `app/therapy/index.tsx`, `app/therapy/session.tsx`, `app/therapy/summary/[id].tsx`
- All 6 therapy API functions in `src/api/client.ts`, all 11 therapy types in `src/types/index.ts`
- Billing: first session free; Pro plan 1/month included, extras at ₹299 member price; ₹499/session standalone (402 returned when no credits) - see docs/PRICING.md

**All Phase 6 features shipped.** Voice input and TTS voice output are fully implemented
(Azure Speech since 2026-06-11, with OpenAI TTS as fallback - see Phase 8b voice table).

### Cost Per Session (text mode)
| | |
|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet with prompt caching | ~$0.70 |
| Whisper (if voice enabled) | ~$0.18 |
| **Total (text only)** | **~$0.70** |

Gross margin at ₹499 (text mode): ~88%.

---

## Phase 7 - Longitudinal Intelligence ✅
Migrations: `000011_monetization.up.sql`, `000013_guided_journeys.up.sql`, `000014_year_in_review.up.sql`, `000015_life_chapters.up.sql`, `000016_dream_decoder.up.sql`, `000017_relationship_map.up.sql`

Features built beyond the original roadmap phases:

### 7a - Subscription & Billing API ✅
- `plan TEXT` + `plan_expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ` columns added to `users`
- `GET /billing/plan` - returns current plan + all plan limits; mobile reads this on Settings screen
- `POST /billing/upgrade` - sets plan (stub in dev, payment gateway in prod)
- Plan gating enforced in handlers: `mood/history`, `reviews/weekly`, `reviews/annual`, `share`, `export/pdf`

### 7b - Guided Journeys ✅
- `journey_templates` + `journey_sessions` + `journey_steps` tables (migration 000013)
- Seeded templates: Stress Relief, Gratitude Practice, Decision Clarity, Grief Processing, Self-Compassion
- `GET /journeys` - list templates; `POST /journeys/:id/start` - create session
- `GET /journeys/sessions`, `GET /journeys/sessions/:id` - session state + step prompts
- `POST /journeys/sessions/:id/advance` - submit entry for current step, advance to next
- Mobile: `app/journeys.tsx` (list + active sessions) and `app/journeys/[sessionId].tsx` (step view)

### 7c - Annual Year in Review ✅
- `annual_reviews` table (migration 000014); auto-scheduled yearly for each user
- Claude generates a narrative + top emotions + top topics + monthly mood arc (JSONB)
- `GET /reviews/annual/latest` and `GET /reviews/annual` - requires Plus or higher
- Displayed in `app/(tabs)/mood.tsx` below the Life Graph

### 7d - Life Chapters ✅
- `life_chapters` table (migration 000015) - user-defined named time periods with start/end dates
- `GET /chapters`, `POST /chapters`, `GET /chapters/:id`, `PUT /chapters/:id`, `DELETE /chapters/:id`
- `GET /chapters/:id/detail` - enriched with entry count, avg mood, top emotions, daily mood arc
- `POST /chapters/:id/summarize` - generates Claude narrative for the chapter period; stored in `summary` column

### 7e - Relationship Map ✅
- `people` + `person_mentions` tables (migration 000017) - extracted automatically from entry transcripts by Claude

---

## Phase 8 - Enhanced Therapy Mode ✅
Migrations: `000020_therapy_personas.up.sql`

Upgrades Therapy Mode (Phase 6) with four AI personas, session memory, graceful wind-down, and layered crisis handling.

### 8a - DB Schema + Models ✅
- `persona TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'comforting'` added to `therapy_sessions` (migration 000020)
- `crisis_warnings INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` added to `therapy_sessions` (migration 000020)
- `TherapyContextSnapshot` carries `PastSessionSummaries []string` (last 3 post-session summaries, fetched at session start)
- `TherapySession` model + repo interface updated with all new fields

### 8b - Therapist Personas ✅
Four personas, each with a distinct system prompt and mapped TTS voice.
Azure Speech voices (empathetic SSML styles; Hindi voices for Hindi turns);
OpenAI voices remain as fallback when `AZURE_TTS_KEY` is unset:

| Persona | Character | Azure voice (EN) · style | Azure voice (HI) | OpenAI fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `comforting` | Warm, validating, gentle - focuses on feelings first | `en-US-JennyNeural` · empathetic | `hi-IN-SwaraNeural` | `nova` |
| `rational` | Logical, structured, Socratic - facts before feelings | `en-US-BrandonNeural` · calm | `hi-IN-MadhurNeural` | `onyx` |
| `cbt` | CBT-informed - identifies thought patterns, challenges distortions | `en-US-AriaNeural` · chat | `hi-IN-SwaraNeural` | `alloy` |
| `mindful` | Grounding, present-moment, breath-aware | `en-US-SaraNeural` · gentle | `hi-IN-SwaraNeural` | `shimmer` |

`AZURE_TTS_USE_HD=true` switches to per-persona DragonHD multilingual voices (EN+HI+Hinglish in one voice, emotion auto-detected):

| Persona | DragonHD voice (EN) | DragonHD voice (Indian/Hindi) |
|---|---|---|
| `comforting` | `en-US-Jenny:DragonHDLatestNeural` | `en-IN-Diya:DragonHDLatestNeural` |
| `rational` | `en-US-Andrew2:DragonHDLatestNeural` | `en-IN-Arjun:DragonHDLatestNeural` |
| `cbt` | `en-US-Aria:DragonHDLatestNeural` | `en-IN-Diya:DragonHDLatestNeural` |
| `mindful` | `en-US-Serena:DragonHDLatestNeural` | `en-IN-Diya:DragonHDLatestNeural` |

`AZURE_TTS_VOICE_OVERRIDE` forces a single voice for all personas/languages and wins over `USE_HD`.

**Voice language preference:** `users.voice_language` (migration 000027, `auto | english | hindi`),
exposed on GET/PUT `/me`, picker in mobile Settings → Therapy. Snapshotted into
`TherapyContextSnapshot.voice_language` at session start.

- `buildPersonaBlock()` dispatches to 4 persona-specific blocks in `prompts.go`
- `POST /therapy/sessions` accepts `persona` field (defaults to `comforting`)
- Persona stored in `therapy_sessions.persona`; used on every turn

### 8c - Session Continuity ✅
- At session start, last 3 completed session `post_session_summary` values fetched via `PastCompletedSummaries`
- Injected into `TherapyContextSnapshot.PastSessionSummaries` (frozen at session start — ADR-016)
- System prompt includes a `MEMORY FROM PAST SESSIONS` block when summaries are present
- Snapshot is read-only for the duration of the session; live journal changes don't affect it

### 8d - Graceful Wind-Down ✅
- `buildWindDownInstruction(timeRemainingSec)` returns time-aware instruction injected into every `SendMessage` call
- When `timeRemainingSec < 600` (10 min): prompt instructs Claude to begin natural close
- When `timeRemainingSec < 120` (2 min): prompt instructs Claude to wrap up in this turn
- `time_remaining_sec` returned in every `session_state` response

### 8e - Layered Crisis Handling ✅
Two-stage behaviour per ADR-014:
1. **Stage 1 (first detection, `crisis_warnings = 0`):** `handleCrisis()` calls `buildDeEscalationPrompt()` → Claude sends grounding response; session stays active; `crisis_warnings` incremented to 1. If Claude unreachable during de-escalation → hard-stop immediately (fail-safe).
2. **Stage 2 (`crisis_warnings >= 1` or Claude unreachable on Stage 1):** `hardStopCrisis()` sets `status = crisis_detected`, returns crisis helplines, closes session permanently.

### 8f - Onboarding Gate: Journal vs Therapy ✅
- Step 4 of onboarding: "How would you like to begin?" screen with Journal and Therapy cards
- Journal → existing record flow; Therapy → persona picker → POST /therapy/sessions

---

## UX Polish ✅
Migration: `000021_age_range.up.sql`

Incremental UX improvements shipped outside phase gates.

### Age Range Collection ✅
- Optional `age_range` column on `users` table (CHECK constraint: `under_18 | 18_24 | 25_34 | 35_44 | 45_plus`)
- Collected as step 3 of onboarding between the name step and the Journal/Therapy gate
- Displayed as a tap-to-select list; tapping a selected range deselects it (skip support without a separate button)
- Button label changes to "Skip" when nothing selected, "Continue" when a range is selected
- Exposed on `GET /me` and accepted on `PUT /me` with enum validation (400 on invalid value)
- Used for internal analytics cohorts; never shown in AI prompts or reflections
- `AgeRange` type added to `src/types/index.ts`; `updateMe` in `src/api/client.ts` accepts the field

### Settings - Profile Modal ✅
- Profile card in Settings now shows `"N entries · Plan name"` instead of email address
- Card is a `TouchableOpacity` with a `›` chevron; tapping opens a bottom-sheet profile modal
- Modal displays: avatar with initials, display name, email, full name, and age range ("Not set" in muted text if absent)
- "Change email address" row → Alert directing user to support@dreamlog.app
- Consistent with existing modal patterns (BlurView + sheet)

### Greeting Splash ✅
- On every cold app open for an authenticated, post-onboarding user, a full-screen overlay fades in with "Hello, [name]"
- Uses `preferred_name` if set, falls back to `name`
- Animation: fade in 400ms → hold 1400ms → fade out 400ms (total ~2.2s)
- Implemented as an `Animated.View` with `absoluteFill` and `zIndex: 999` inside `ThemeProvider` in `app/_layout.tsx`
- Uses `CormorantGaramond_300Light` 36px matching the app's serif palette
- Does not show during onboarding, on auth screen, or if user has no name

### Therapy Session Screen - Voice-First Redesign ✅
- Screen rebuilt to mirror the journal record screen aesthetic: pulsating mic orb as the primary UI element
- `SessionOrb` (160px): idle breathing pulse (1.03x), strong pulse + glow + red tint while recording, `ActivityIndicator` overlay while waiting for AI response
- `Waveform` component (9 animated bars with staggered delays) shown while recording - matches `record.tsx` pattern
- Dual input modes controlled by local state:
  - **Voice mode** (default): header with persona/timer/End button; message scroll limited to `maxHeight: 38%` above orb; "Chat" button opens text mode
  - **Text mode**: full-height chat list, keyboard-aware text input + send; auto-returns to voice after send
- Crisis and session-ended states preserved from original implementation

### Therapy Pricing Screen ✅ (`app/therapy/pricing.tsx`)
- New dedicated screen for therapy session purchase options: Single, 5-Pack, 12-Pack, Pro plan
- Currency auto-detected via `detectAndCacheRegion()` on mount - same pattern as `app/upgrade.tsx`; no manual toggle
- Shows `ActivityIndicator` while region is loading, then renders prices in the detected currency (INR for India, USD elsewhere)
- `OptionCard` component: badge, title, subtitle, price, per-session breakdown, saving badge, feature checklist, CTA
- Persona chip horizontal scroll to preview companion styles before purchasing
- "Every session includes" info box + safety disclaimer at bottom
- Pro CTA → `app/upgrade.tsx`; session pack CTAs → `app/therapy/persona-picker.tsx`

### Therapy Index Screen - Hero Redesign ✅ (`app/therapy/index.tsx`)
- Complete redesign replacing the minimal "Start a Session" landing with a rich hero screen
- `AmbientGlow` pulsating blob behind the hero (position absolute, does not scroll with content)
- Hero: small-caps eyebrow label, 38px `CormorantGaramond_300Light` heading, supporting copy
- Feature chip strip: 5 horizontal scroll pills (Voice or text, Up to 60 min, Journal-aware AI, Post-session summary, Crisis detection)
- Active session resume banner: shown only when a session has `status === 'active'`; taps straight into that session
- Companion styles preview: horizontal scroll of 4 persona cards (emoji, name, tagline)
- Stats bar: total sessions / total turns / completed count; hidden when user has no session history
- `SessionCard` redesign: left accent bar (brand color = active, muted = otherwise), status badge, persona emoji + name, date, 2-line summary, turn count + duration meta

### Therapy - 402 Credit Redirect ✅
- When `POST /therapy/sessions` returns 402 (no session credits), `app/therapy/persona-picker.tsx` now calls `router.replace('/therapy/pricing')` instead of showing an Alert
- User lands directly on the pricing screen where they can purchase a session pack or upgrade to Pro

---

## Store Launch Prep 🚧
Tracking doc: `docs/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` (single source of truth for everything left before launch)

One codebase ships to both stores via EAS — no separate iOS app. Shared `version` in
`mobile/app.json`; per-platform build numbers auto-incremented remotely by EAS.

### Shipped 2026-06-11
- **Push notifications fixed end-to-end** (were silently dead on both platforms):
  - Backend `services/fcm.go`: real OAuth token exchange via `golang.org/x/oauth2/google`
    (was a stub that always errored) + unit tests
  - Mobile: `@react-native-firebase/app` + `messaging` installed; `src/services/push.ts`
    registers the FCM token on auth (`POST /devices`), handles Android 13 permission +
    token rotation; fail-silent
  - Requires a new native build (`eas build`) — push does not work in Expo Go or via OTA update
- **Sign in with Apple** (App Store Guideline 4.8): native button on auth screen (iOS only),
  via Supabase `signInWithIdToken`; `ios.usesAppleSignIn` set
- **iOS build config**: `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false`, static frameworks
  (`expo-build-properties`), `eas.json` dev profile now points at Railway (not localhost)
- **Makefile release targets**: `mobile-build-*-ios`, `mobile-submit-android/ios`,
  `mobile-device-ios`, `mobile-versions`
- **Demo/tester account** created in production Supabase (credentials in LAUNCH_CHECKLIST §2d)

### Remaining (needs owner accounts — see LAUNCH_CHECKLIST §1, §2b, §2c)
- Apple Developer enrollment → APNs key, `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS builds fail without it),
  iOS OAuth client for Google Sign-In, Supabase Apple provider
- IAP vs web-only purchase decision (biggest blocker, both stores)
- Privacy policy, store listings, data-safety forms, Sentry/uptime monitoring, CI race-detector gate

## Phase 9 - Therapist Workspace ✅
Migration: `000034_therapist_notes.up.sql` · Full doc: `docs/THERAPIST_PORTAL.md`

Makes DreamLog a therapist's daily practice tool - in the app and the web portal - for
their own offline clients, not just linked app users.

Built:
- **Login pill** on the mobile auth screen ("For me" / "I'm a therapist"); therapists land
  on the workspace, get a "My journal →" button (full user product included), and normal
  users never see therapist surfaces (`GET /therapists/me` 404-gates routing)
- **External clients**: therapist-owned client records (name encrypted at rest), CRUD +
  archive, cascade-delete of all notes
- **Photo-of-notes OCR**: presign → PUT to R2 → `NoteOCRWorker` runs Claude vision →
  editable bullet list; photo deleted immediately after extraction (ADR-019); typed-notes
  path for no-photo sessions; per-session status polling like the entry pipeline
- **AI session summary**: on-demand 3-5 sentence professional recap; client identity never
  sent to the AI; stored encrypted
- **Envelope encryption** (ADR-017): per-therapist AES-256-GCM data keys wrapped by
  `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; DB holds only ciphertext; explicitly NOT end-to-end
- **No crisis screening on notes** (ADR-018)
- **Consent layer**: user ToS checkbox at signup + `/accept-terms` gate for OAuth and
  version bumps (`users.tos_accepted_at/tos_version`); therapist client-data consent
  enforced server-side before any client/note creation
- **Dashboard metrics**: clients, sessions this week/month/total, per-client history
- **Web portal parity**: `/dashboard/notes` in `therapist-portal/` (upload, edit, summarize)
- Mobile: `app/therapist/{index,register,clients,add-session}.tsx`,
  `app/therapist/client/[id].tsx`, `app/therapist/session/[id].tsx`, `app/accept-terms.tsx`
- Tests: crypto round-trip/tamper, ownership isolation, consent gating, OCR worker
  (photo deleted on success not failure, DLQ, orphan cleanup), no-plaintext-at-rest
